Retrieve character encoding and convert to UTF-8 in JSON.
For the time being check encoding and abort with a message saying only UTF-8

Implement source. Implement reader interface and some readers.

Align "case" with "switch" everywhere.

Use include <...> instead of include "..." wherever possible.

Make all if statements use braces, even single-line ones.

Consider pluggable memory allocation when library grows bigger and there is a
