    can we have any options?

can tlog be used as sudo shell?
    we can allow commands starting with "tlog" only
    assign shell for target user?

shall we rename to logsh?
    no - the name's taken

need monotonic clock for playback, but also need realtime clock for search,
how to combine?

publish design document on FreeIPA wiki
focus on client side, wait for the server side
have realtime playback as the first demo milestone

Ask Jakub and Martin for review once logging is working.

Retrieve character encoding and convert to UTF-8 in JSON.
For the time being check encoding and abort with a message saying only UTF-8
is supported.

Specify number of characters in timing.
This also means that we can't encode incomplete UTF-8 characters.
So we have to keep incomplete characters until they're completed and have two
kinds of flushes: one keeping the incomplete characters and one flushing
everything and encoding incomplete characters.

Round timing delay appropriately so it doesn't drift over the start of the
next message.

Merge zero delay chunks in timing.

Check why we get delay at the start of timing sometimes and if possible get
rid of it.

Fix negative position timestamp we get sometimes.

Add a start message with the terminal type.

Add message versions

Move clock management outside tlog_sink. This will allow the user code to
choose the timer and the tests to become reliable.

Disable assertions in non-debug build.

Consider removing tlog_rc type and using bool instead.

Refactor tlog.c

Make proper stream snapshots in tlog_io_write.

Add throttling.

Observe current timestamp in tlog_io_cut.
