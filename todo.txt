need monotonic clock for playback, but also need realtime clock for search,
how to combine?

publish design document on FreeIPA wiki
focus on client side, wait for the server side

Ask Jakub and Martin for review once logging is working.

Retrieve character encoding and convert to UTF-8 in JSON.
For the time being check encoding and abort with a message saying only UTF-8
is supported.

Specify number of characters in timing.
This also means that we can't encode incomplete UTF-8 characters.
Round timing delay appropriately so it doesn't drift over the start of the
next message.
