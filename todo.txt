Retrieve character encoding and convert to UTF-8 in JSON.
For the time being check encoding and abort with a message saying only UTF-8
is supported.

Add a start message with the terminal type.

Add message versions

Disable assertions in non-debug build.

Refactor tlog.c

Add throttling.

Provide comprehensive object descriptions in header files.

Use include <...> instead of include "..." wherever possible.

Make all if statements use braces, even single-line ones.

Consider pluggable memory allocation when library grows bigger and there is a
potential for outside users.

Consider building release code with NDEBUG.

Make tlog_msg functions return diverse global return codes to help with
debugging parsing errors.

Test the code with coverity.

Consider supporting merging several messages into a single packet when
reading.

Consider making sink accept packets for input.

Consider merging window and io messages for simplicity.

Check if there is a way to unify init/cleanup and create/destroy function
presence across object types.
