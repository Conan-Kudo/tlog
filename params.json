{"name":"tlog","tagline":"Terminal I/O logger","body":"Tlog is a terminal I/O logging and playback package. It inserts itself (the\r\n`tlog-rec` tool) between the user terminal and the user shell, and logs\r\neverything that passes through as JSON messages.\r\n\r\nThe JSON messages are structured to be particularly suitable for storage and\r\nsearching by ElasticSearch, plus for (limited) human review. At the same time,\r\nthey preserve all the passed data and timing (with 1ms resolution).\r\n\r\nAt the moment terminal output playback is possible using the `tlog-play` tool\r\ndirectly from ElasticSearch URL with the supplied query.\r\n\r\nTlog is intended to be used as part of a larger user session recording\r\nsolution, but is designed to be independent and reusable.\r\n\r\nSee also [a blog post on Open-Source Session Recording][blog_post] and the\r\n[WIP design page][design_page].\r\n\r\n[blog_post]: http://spbnick.github.io/2015/10/26/open-source-session-recording.html\r\n[design_page]: http://www.freeipa.org/page/Session_Recording\r\n","google":"UA-72218226-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
